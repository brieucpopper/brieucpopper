Some interesting projects I worked on in the past are:
  - A 3D tetris with a 2d rendering coded manually in Python https://github.com/brieucpopper/3dtetris
  - A multiplayer web game that is a 2v2 drawing competition (with sockets, some javascript and a flask python server) https://github.com/brieucpopper/drawhosted/tree/master/Projet%20Final
  -A way to encode drawings with fourier decompositions to determine whether it would be possible to encode a drawing by storing it's fourier coefficients https://github.com/brieucpopper/TIPE-fourier-bezier
  - A 16-bit computer that implements a custom programming language and can do tasks such as compute the fibonacci sequence https://github.com/brieucpopper/logismcomputer
